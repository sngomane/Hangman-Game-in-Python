# Hangman-Game-in-Python

# Summary:
This is a  fun and  interactive hangman game which can be played inside a python notebook developed to revise the following python concepts:
Python numbers, strings, lists and dictionaries 
If/else statements
For loops 
While loops 
## Languages and  Libraries Used: 
Python and Random Library 
## The Game 
Please see: [Hangman Game](https://github.com/sngomane/Hangman-Game-in-Python/blob/main/Hangman_Game.ipynb)
## Key Learnings and challenges overcome:
This was my first python project as part of The Data Analytics Intensive Bootcamp curriculum at WBS coding school. During this project week I learnt the basics of python syntax  which is simple but different from MySQL.  It was a steep learning curve particularly understanding python loops. Nonetheless,  after perseverance and revising mathematical functions,  I was able to understand them a lot better. I also found the following website: python tutor  visualiser very useful for visualising  how python executes loops which made it a lot easier to conceptualise the required loops for the hangman game.
